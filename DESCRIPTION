Description: As the assays of multi-omics experiments have grown in complexity
    and number they have become more difficult to model in data structures, at
    least for the case of unified analysis. Bioconductor's MultiAssayExperiment
    class enables such unified analysis and the complexity of data from The
    Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) represent a practical use case for the data
    structre. As such, the curatedTCGAData package has assembled and curated the
    entirety of the data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) as
    MultiAssayExperiment objects.
